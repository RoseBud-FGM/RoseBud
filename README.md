# What is FGM/C?
FGM/C stands for Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting. It is a harmful cultural practice that involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. FGM/C is typically carried out on girls before they reach puberty and is a violation of their human rights. It can cause serious health problems, including severe pain, infection, difficulty urinating, and complications during childbirth. FGM/C is internationally recognized as a form of violence against women and is outlawed in many countries, but it is still practiced in some parts of Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.

# Our Role
We, the members of team PutridCookies from India have made a web application to fight Female Genital Mutilation. 
Leverage of technology, community-driven approaches, and data-driven solutions to effectively eliminate the practice of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) worldwide, support survivors and at-risk individuals, and promote gender equality.	
Our aim is to raise awareness about the harms of FGM/C and encourage reporting of incidents to empower girls and women, promote their health and well-being, and ultimately end the practice within our community.

# Our Solution
Our solution is a web app that connects at-risk girls and women with resources and support to prevent and address female genital mutilation. It features a user-friendly interface, API integration, and authentication, all powered by a scalable cloud-based architecture.

Our team chose a client-server architecture for our solution. The high-level components of our architecture are the front-end user interface, back-end server, database, API integration, and authentication.  
High Level Components:Front-end user interface,Back-end server,Database,API integration,Authentication 
Responsibilities of each Component:The front-end component allows the interaction with the web app,server-side component is responsible for processing requests,database component stores and manages the web app's data. API integration involves connecting the web app with external.APIs retrieves and displays data, and requires careful planning and testing to ensure compatibility and security.Authentication handles user login and access control. 
Platform used for each Component: Front-end user interface:Angular framework|Back-end server: Firebase|Database:Firebase Firestore|API Integration:Google Maps,Google Translate|Authentication: AngularFireAuth
Login:To authenticate and manage user types and accounts-> Angular,Firebase Authentication.
Report:To report incidences of forced genital mutilation of females ->Angular, Firebase Firestore, GoogleMaps API
Tracking:Tracker To track progress and evaluation of submitted reports ->Angular,Firebase Firestore
Support Section: To help and provide medical aid and guidance to victims-> Angular,Firebase Firestore
Awareness Section:To promote awareness and provide relevant resources covering the topic->Angular,Google Translate API
